# Binary Search

Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element to
look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.

Use the template in `code.js`. The tests in `code.test.js` will be run
automatically every time you push to Github; if they pass you are done.

I used ChatGPT-4 with the following prompt: "what does counter example mean?"
Response:
  A counterexample in the context of property-based testing (e.g., with jsverify) is an input that violates the property you're testing. It is a concrete example of input data for which the function does not behave as expected.

I wasn't too sure what jsverify meant by counterexample, but now I know that it is the tested array/list that caused the error.

I certify that I have listed all sources used to complete this exercise, including the use of any Large Language Models. All of the work is my own, except where stated otherwise. I am aware that plagiarism carries severe penalties and that if plagiarism is suspected, charges may be filed against me without prior notice.
